<h1>OpenDCT Readme</h1>
<p>
	OpenDCT is an open source digital cable tuner network encoder for
	<a href="http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/index.php">SageTV</a>.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
	The majority of the configuration is done inside opendct.properties. The file is automatically
	populated after the first time the program is run. Do not make changes to this file while the program
	is running since your changes will be overwritten. This list is just the very basics to keep the
	program from communicating with undesired devices.
</p>
<p>
	After configuring OpenDCT, the SageTV service needs to be stopped. Open Sage.properties and find the
	property network_encoder_discovery and change the value to true. Start the SageTV service again while
	OpenDCT is running to discover the available capture devices.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>sagetv.device.global.ignore_devices_csv=</li>
	<ul><li>
		This is a comma delimited list of tuners or entire devices to be ignored if they are discovered.
		The names on this list must perfectly match the name of the tuner or "parent" device as it is named
		when discovered. When a device is on the list, all tuners on that device will be excluded.
	</li></ul><p/>

	<li>sagetv.device.global.only_devices_csv=</li>
	<ul><li>
		This property if set always supersedes ignore_devices_csv. This is a comma delimited list of tuners
		or entire devices allowed to be initialized if they are discovered. The names on this list must 
		perfectly match the name of the tuner or "parent" device as it is named when discovered.
	</li></ul><p/>

	<li>sagetv.device.global.required_devices_loaded_timeout_ms=30000</li>
	<ul><li>
		This is the amount of time allowed in milliseconds to pass while waiting for the required number of
		devices before the program will exit with a failure.
	</li></ul><p/>

	<li>sagetv.device.global.required_devices_loaded_count=0</li>
	<ul><li>
		This is the number of devices that need to be detected and loaded before the required timeout.
	</li></ul><p/>
	
	<li>sagetv.device.<unique_id>.device_name</li>
	<ul><li>
		The name of the device can be changed by this property. If you change the name here, you will need
		to re-detect the capture device in SageTV or SageTV will not be able to communicate with it
		anymore. Capture devices cannot have the same name.
	</li></ul><p/>
</ul>

<h1>Reporting Issues</h1>
<p>
	First check the <a href="http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/index.php">SageTV forums</a> to help eliminate
	other possibilities in your environment/configuration that are unrelated to OpenDCT. Also the forums
	could help if the issue is actually a problem resultsing from an incorrect configuration of OpenDCT. If
	it is determined that it must be an issue with OpenDCT that should be addressed, please create a
	<a href="https://github.com/enternoescape/opendct/issues/new">new issue on GitHub</a>. Please be very
	specific and attach SageTV and OpenDCT log files if possible.
