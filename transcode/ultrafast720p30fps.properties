# OpenDCT Live Transcoding Profile

# Set this to true to always reload these properties when this transcoding profile is requested.
# Alternatively these properties are only loaded once.
g.conf.always_reload=false

# This is the profile name to be displayed. When referencing this profile in opendct.properties, use
# the name of this file without the .properties extension.
g.conf.friendly_name=Ultra High Speed
g.conf.description=Fastest settings with scaling to 720p 30FPS. Unscaled 720p video is 60fps.

# Change this value to true to disable transcoding on all capture devices using this profile. This
# effectively will cause all video streams to be copied instead.
g.conf.disable=false

# If this is true, transcoding will only happen if the content is interlaced.
v.conf.t.deinterlace_only=true

# If this is false, all content will be assumed progressive. The deinterlace_only option must be set
# false if this options is set false or no transcoding will happen. Interlaced content can still be
# detected by filters, but progressive_filter will always be selected.
v.conf.t.deinterlace_detect=true

# If this is true, transcoding will always happen even if the program is transcoding to the exact
# same format.
v.conf.t.always=false

# This is the default video codec to be used for all video encoding. Note that the encoder is
# referred to as 'libx264' when it is retrieved by name because that is how FFmpeg names to the
# codec. However, settings are referred to as 'h264' because that is what the codec returns as its
# name.
v.conf.e.default.codec=libx264

# A codec can be mapped to another codec so that if for example you want all mpeg2video to be
# converted to H.264, you can uncomment the line below. When this option is defined, transcoding
# will happen regardless of other options whenever the video format is in this example mpeg2video.
#v.conf.t.codec_map.mpeg2video=libx264

# A codec can be transcoded to a preferred codec. QuickSync is not available yet, but this is
# how you would tell the program to use the alternate codec. 'd' is decoding. 'e' is encoding.

# Two threads is more than enough for one transcoding. Reasons to not use more threads:
# 1) If more than one transcoding is being performed at the same time, the CPU cache hits will
# decrease as all of the cores are intensely working simultaneously on very different content.
# 2) The more cores involved, the longer it actually takes before the first frame is written and
# for the last frame to be written.
# 3) The decoding and filtering are all currently done on one thread and will potentially limit the
# scalability.

# These are all of the settings available. The value here is not necessarily the default. You may
